# About me

I'm a technical communicator with experience in, but not limited to:
* user & reference guides; handbooks; job aids
* business, operations, & technical procedures
* process flow modeling
* documentation standards (style & usage guides; glossary; templates; publication workflows)
* editing & proofreading
* UX writing

A long time ago, I was a software developer; I can still communicate with developers and understand them to complete
any task successfully. I'm also a certified English as a second language teacher and have a degree in Mechanical
Engineering.

# Skills

I'm a very quick learner. I built this resume by learning to use the personal edition of HelpNDoc, which is a Help
Authoring Tool (HAT) similar to Madcap Flare and RoboHelp.

* HelpNDoc, Confluence, HTML
* Word, PowerPoint, Excel; Paint (image manipulation)
* Visio, LucidChart
* SnagIT, Lightshot (screen capture)
* Zeplin (UX)
* SharePoint, Egnyte (document repositories)
* JIRA (task tracking with doc Kanban board / documentation workflow)

My main strengths are communication, time management, and relationship building, which are crucial to succeed. I'm
also functionally proficient in French; and have a limited conversational proficiency in Spanish.
