# About me

* user & reference guides; handbooks; job aids
* business, operations, & technical procedures
* process flow modeling
* documentation standards (style & usage guides; glossary; templates; publication workflows)
* editing & proofreading
* UX writing

A long time ago, I was a software developer; I can still communicate with developers and understand them to complete
any task successfully. I'm also a certified English as a second language teacher and have a degree in Mechanical
Engineering.
